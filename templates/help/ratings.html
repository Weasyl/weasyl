    <h3>How Do I Rate Content I Submit?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <section id="overview">
        <p>Content rating is determined on the existence and degree of five
        primary factors*: language, nudity, sexual situations, violence, and
        drug use. The following outlines the acceptable criteria for each
        content rating:</p>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:8em;">General</th>
            <td>Appropriate for all audiences of all ages.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Mature</th>
            <td>Contains imagery, themes or material that is not suitable for
            minors. Excludes graphic depiction of sexual content or sexual
            acts, including depictions of sexual arousal.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Explicit</th>
            <td>Extension of the Mature rating for content containing
            graphic depictions of sexual content or sexual acts. This may
            contain dramatized sex acts or overt sexual situations. This may
            contain overt depictions of sexual acts or sexual arousal.</td>

      <p>We ask that you use your best judgement when rating your content.
      Please consider the intended audience and context of the content you
      submit. When in doubt please use a higher rating. Below is a detailed
      guideline for content rating criteria:</p>

      <section id="general">
        <header>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <h5>All Audiences</h5>

          <p>Contains <strong>no</strong> mature content.

          <tr>
            <th style="width:10em;">Language</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Nudity</th>
            <td>May contain only non-detailed (cartoon, “Barbie-doll”, or
            similar) nudity or partial nudity (revealing clothing, such as
            bikinis or bathing suits).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Sexual Situations</th>
            <td>Contains <strong>no sexual situations</strong>. Must be free of
            any sexual conduct or themes. Displays of platonic affection
            are acceptable (e.g. hugs).</td>

            erotic fashion is permissible as long as it does not meet the
            criteria for Explicit; sexual paraphernalia (such as sex toys),
