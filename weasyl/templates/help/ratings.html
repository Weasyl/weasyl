    <h3>How Do I Rate Content I Submit?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <section id="overview">
        <p>Content rating is determined on the existence and degree of five
        primary factors*: language, nudity, sexual situations, violence, and
        drug use. The following outlines the acceptable criteria for each
        content rating:</p>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:8em;">General</th>
            <td>Appropriate for all audiences of all ages.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Moderate</th>
            <td>Content categorized as Moderate contains themes and imagery
            that are more suggestive than General but still remain suitable for
            minors 13 years of age or older. Overt and/or blatant depictions of
            mature subjects may not be categorized under Moderate.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Mature</th>
            <td>Contains imagery, themes or material that is not suitable for
            minors. Excludes graphic depiction of sexual content or sexual
            acts, including depictions of sexual arousal.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Explicit</th>
            <td>Extension of the Mature rating for content containing
            graphic depictions of sexual content or sexual acts. This may
            contain dramatized sex acts or overt sexual situations. This may
            contain overt depictions of sexual acts or sexual arousal.</td>

      <p>We ask that you use your best judgement when rating your content.
      Please consider the intended audience and context of the content you
      submit. When in doubt please use a higher rating. Below is a detailed
      guideline for content rating criteria:</p>

      <section id="general">
        <header>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <h5>All Audiences</h5>

          <p>Contains <strong>no</strong> mature content.
          Must be suitable for all audiences.</p>
        </header>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:10em;">Language</th>

            <th>Nudity</th>
            <td>May contain only non-detailed (cartoon, “Barbie-doll”, or
            similar) nudity or partial nudity (revealing clothing, such as
            bikinis or bathing suits). Also, submissions with a compositional
            focus on sexualized anatomy must be rated at least Moderate.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Sexual Situations</th>
            <td>Contains <strong>no sexual situations</strong>. Must be free of
            any sexual conduct or themes. Displays of platonic affection
            are acceptable (e.g. hugs).</td>

            <th>Violence</th>
            <td>May contain mild cartoon/stylized depictions of blood, injury,

            include distinctly defined genitalia, nor distinctly defined nipples

            This includes implied sexual acts, references, behavior, or the
            presence of mild sexual situations or discussion. Sexualized or
            erotic fashion is permissible as long as it does not meet the
            criteria for Explicit; sexual paraphernalia (such as sex toys),
            however, must be rated Explicit.</td>

            contain a small amount of imagery or situations that may be
