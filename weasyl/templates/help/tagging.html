    <h3>How Do I Tag My Work?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <p>Upon submission of a visual, literary or multimedia piece you are prompted with a text box in which you can input tags; as shown here:</p>

      <figure class="help-image">
        <img src="${resource_path('img/help/help-tagging1.jpg')}" alt="" width="826" height="194" />
      </figure>

      <p>Let's assume we're uploading a visual submission. We will use this picture of Wesley as an example:</p>

      <figure class="help-image">
        <img src="${resource_path('img/help/help-tagging2.jpg')}" alt="" width="600" height="600" />
      </figure>

      <p>As it is stated in the Community Guidelines; each submission <i>requires a minimum of three tags</i>. So let's start with a few basic tags:</p>

      <figure class="help-image">
        <img src="${resource_path('img/help/help-tagging3.jpg')}" alt="" width="404" height="237" />
      </figure>

      <p>It's important to keep your tags as accurate and relevant as possible. For the above picture we have described the category <strong>anthro</strong>, species <strong>weasel</strong>, medium <strong>cel_shading</strong> as well as some relevant tags such as <strong>wesley</strong> (being a picture of Wesley) and <strong>drawing</strong> (depiction of such activity). </p>
    </div>

    <h3>How Do I Tag My Work?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <p>Say we want to describe the picture containing a big pencil. As described in the above shot, a single tag is locked into a box after pressing space. Multiple-word tags are separated with an underscore ( _ ), like so:</p>

      <figure class="help-image">
        <img src="${resource_path('img/help/help-tagging4.jpg')}" alt="" width="405" height="266" />
      </figure>

      <p>So why can't you just type "big pencil"?</p>
      <p>As described above; the system works such that by typing a word and then hitting space bar, it is locked to a box; treating it as a single tag. This would mean that typing <strong>big pencil</strong> would result in adding two tags: <strong>big</strong> and <strong>pencil</strong>.</p>
      <p>This results in poor accuracy as well as a pile of redundant tags, especially when a tag contains more than two words. For example, if your tag was something like <strong>this is a tag</strong>, not including underscores results in four tags: <strong>this</strong>, <strong>is</strong>, <strong>a</strong> and <strong>tag</strong>. You don't want that!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Strong vs. Poor Tags</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <p>While you may add as many relevant tags as possible, there comes a point where too much detail can result in poor accuracy. Let's take apart every single detail in the picture above and attach it onto a tag:</p>

      <figure class="help-image">
        <img src="${resource_path('img/help/help-tagging5.jpg')}" alt="" width="405" height="266" />
      </figure>

      <p>This is an example of weak tags that do not aid our search engine, tag filter system or make it easier to discover your work. While tags such as <strong>nose</strong> and <strong>black</strong> are relevant in that they are present in small portions of the image, they are pointless and redundant <i>unless they bear major prominence in the image</i>.</p>
      <p>Let's improve these tags:</p>

      <figure class="help-image">
        <img src="${resource_path('img/help/help-tagging6.jpg')}" alt="" width="409" height="323" />
      </figure>

      <p>Here I have kept <strong>brown</strong> since it's majorly pertinent to the image (i.e Wesley is a brown weasel). This means tags such as <strong>brown_weasel</strong>, <strong>brown</strong> and <strong>weasel</strong> are applicable tags. If you feel you should be more specific with certain colored body parts, such as his eyes: <strong>blue_eyes</strong> would be a much more accurate tag than <strong>blue eyes</strong>.</p>
