    <div class="formatted-content">
      <p>Account verification helps keep spambots off Weasyl by requiring every new account to be vouched for by an established member of the community before features like commenting, writing journals, and uploading are available.</p>

      <p>If you don’t know anyone with an account, please first <a href="/control/editprofile">fill out your profile</a>, including at least one link to your profile on another website, then e-mail support at <a href="mailto:${M.MACRO_SUPPORT_ADDRESS}">${M.MACRO_SUPPORT_ADDRESS}</a>.
