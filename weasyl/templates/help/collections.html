    <h3>What Are Collections?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <p>The Collections system's main purpose is to cut down on duplicate uploads of the same piece. The original creator of the work receives full recognition for their work, and anyone who collects the work gets the benefit of being notified when users favorite and comment on the work as well.</p>

      <p>Although we have this system, users are <strong>still allowed</strong> to upload pieces made for them/that include them. However, we do encourage users to try the Collections feature.</p>
