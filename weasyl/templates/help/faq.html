    <h3>General Questions:</h3>
    <div class="formatted-content help-examples">
      <h4 id="what-makes-us-different">What makes your site different from others?</h4>
      <p>There are a few things that makes us different:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Our <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/policy/scoc">Staff Code of Conduct</a></strong>, which is publicly available, and has procedures in place to deal with issues involving mods and admins.</li>
        <li><strong>Our <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/help/collections">Collections</a> system</strong>, an optional feature where users who create things for someone can offer that submission to that person’s Collections. Collections can also feature photographs of that person.</li>
        <li><strong>Streaming Notifications</strong>. There is a separate type of notification to let users know that you’re streaming content. Not only that, but any visitor to Weasyl can see ALL streams in progress by going to <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/streaming">https://www.weasyl.com/streaming</a>.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="https://www.weasyl.com/help/tagging">Tagging</a></strong>, which is the way search is used to find submissions you create. Our search system can be used to filter and find any content that’s tagged properly, making it a powerful tool to find and discover artwork.</li>
        <li><strong>High file size limits</strong>. Our current size limits on content are: 10MB for images (including gifs), 15MB for mp3 and swf. Cover artwork is limited to 2MB for jpeg, 5MB for gif or png.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="icon-markup">How do I make other users' icons appear in my profile, in a description, in a comment, etc.?</h4>
      <p>Typing either <strong>&lt;~Wesley></strong>, <strong>&lt;!Wesley></strong> or <strong>&lt;!~Wesley></strong>, will appear as <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/~Wesley">Wesley</a>, <a href="/~wesley" class="user-icon"><img src="/~wesley/avatar" alt="Wesley"></a> or <a href="/~wesley" class="user-icon"><img src="/~wesley/avatar"><span>Wesley</span></a>.</p>

      <p>Please see the "Referencing users" section of the <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/help/markdown">Weasyl Markdown formatting help page</a> for more information.</p>

      <h4 id="artwork-not-appearing">I submitted some artwork and it hasn't appeared on the front page yet. What's going on?</h4>
      <p>The content on the front page is updated every few minutes, so it may take a short while for your submission to appear. Also, if you upload more than three submissions, only the most recent three will be visible on the front page.</p>

      <h4 id="editing-submissions">How do I edit or remove submissions and journals?</h4>
      <p>While on the submission or journal screen, there will be a category titled "Submission Management" or "Journal Management" directly underneath the Information bar. Here you will be able to edit details and remove your submissions or journals. You are also able to edit your thumbnails here.</p>

      <h4 id="reporting">How do I report something?</h4>
      <p>Under all submissions and journals, you will find an exclamation point with the word "report" next to it. Click the button, select what kind of violation the submission or journal is from the drop down box and write any necessary information in the text field. When finished, click the "Send Report" button and your report will be delivered to Administration.</p>

      <p>You can view your submitted reports by clicking on <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/help/reports">My Reports</a>, which can be found in at the bottom of the site in the footer, under Support.</p>

      <h4 id="multiple-accounts">Can users have multiple accounts?</h4>
      <p>Users are allowed to have more than one account, as long as it's not for the purpose of separating between art mediums or level of completeness (as that's what folders are for), for changing your username (as we have a function for that), or impersonating another individual.</p>

      <h4 id="password-recovery">Help! I can't get back into my account!</h4>
      <p>If the password to your account has been changed, or you've forgotten your password, click Log In, and then click "Forgot Your Password?" to enter the relevant information.</p>

      <p>If you’ve been locked out of the email account associated with your Weasyl handle, contact <a href="mailto:support@weasyl.com">support@weasyl.com</a> for additional assistance.</p>

      <h4 id="bug-reports">I found something that's not working correctly on the site. What should I do?</h4>
      <p>You can either post about the bug in our <a href="https://forums.weasyl.com/vbulletin/forumdisplay.php?15-Site-amp-Forum-Support">Site and Forum Support board</a> (although please check to see if there's a thread about your problem before starting a new one!), or email us at <a href="mailto:support@weasyl.com">support@weasyl.com</a></p>

      <h4 id="volunteering">Is there any way I can volunteer to help the site?</h4>
      <p>We'll let the public know when openings become available along with information on how to apply, so keep an ear out!</p>

      <h4 id="friend-or-follow">What’s the difference between friend and follow?</h4>
      <p>Following someone allows you to keep up to date on their site activity depending on your follower settings. By default, you receive notifications whenever they post or collect new art and characters, post journals, and if they are streaming.</p>

      <p>Friending a user will not give you any site notifications, instead, you can view any content that the user has set to “friends-only”. Users additionally can set their shouts and notes to only be allowed from friends.</p>

      <h4 id="ads">Does Weasyl have an ad service?</h4>
      <p>Currently Weasyl does not have an advertising service, though we plan to allow community ads in the future.</p>

      <h4 id="contact-staff">How do I contact someone on staff?</h4>
      <p>Our staff list can be found by navigating to the bottom of our site to our footer. Under About, click on <a href="https://www.weasyl.com/staff">Staff</a> to access the page. We recommend users report content through our site features, or send an email to <a href="mailto:support@weasyl.com">support@weasyl.com</a> instead of contacting a staff member directly for assistance.</p>

      <p>Staff members will always have a tag beside their name designating their staff rank on their comments, notes and profile. <strong>Weasyl staff will NEVER ask a user for their password.</strong></p>

    <div class="formatted-content help-examples">
      <h4 id="categories">Can I browse content by categories?</h4>
      <p>We do not and will not have any way to browse content by global categories, since our search system is tag based. That being said, Weasyl has a powerful tag search system.

You can return to your bookmark at any time to browse the custom set of tags you are interested in.</p>
