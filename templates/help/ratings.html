    <h3>How Do I Rate Content I Submit?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <section id="overview">
        <p>Content rating is determined on the existence and degree of five
        primary factors*: language, nudity, sexual situations, violence, and
        drug use. The following outlines the acceptable criteria for each
        content rating:</p>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:8em;">General</th>
            <td>Appropriate for all audiences of all ages.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Mature</th>
            <td>Contains imagery, themes or material that is not suitable for
            minors. Excludes graphic depiction of sexual content or sexual
            acts, including depictions of sexual arousal.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Explicit</th>
            <td>Extension of the Mature rating for content containing
            graphic depictions of sexual content or sexual acts. This may
            contain dramatized sex acts or overt sexual situations. This may
            contain overt depictions of sexual acts or sexual arousal.</td>
          </tr>

      <p>We ask that you use your best judgement when rating your content.
      Please consider the intended audience and context of the content you
      submit. When in doubt please use a higher rating. Below is a detailed
      guideline for content rating criteria:</p>

      <section id="general">
        <header>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <h5>All Audiences</h5>

          <p>Contains <strong>no</strong> mature or explicit content.  Content must be suitable for audiences under 18.</p>
        </header>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:10em;">Language</th>
            <td>May contain mild use of mild expletives or profanity.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Nudity</th>
            <td>May contain a compositional focus on sexualized anatomy (mammaries, buttocks, groin bulges, etc.) of clothed or partially clothed characters, or non-detailed nudity.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Sexual Situations</th>
            <td>May contain mild implications of sexual activity or themes. This includes implied sexual acts, references, behavior, or the presence of mild sexual situations or discussion. Sexualized or erotic fashion is permissible as long as it does not meet the criteria for Explicit.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Violence</th>
            <td>May contain mild violence or fantasy violence. May contain a small amount of imagery or situations that may be disturbing to sensitive viewers (e.g., depictions of disgusting or scary content in a horror or fantasy context). Violence depicted must not be gory or sexual in nature or heavily detailed/realistic.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Drug Use</th>
            <td>May contain mild drug use or implied use, including excessive consumption of alcohol or tobacco. May include incidental or comedic use of drugs such as marijuana, sativa, hallucinogens or prescription drugs.</td>
