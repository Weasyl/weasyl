    <h3>Final Step: Verify Receipt of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Recovery Codes</h3>
    <h4>You've almost enabled 2FA for your account. One final step remains!</h4>

    <br />

    <p>
      <strong>Print these codes, and secure them as you would your password.</strong>
      In the event you lose access to your authenticator app, you will need these
      codes to regain access to your Weasyl account. Recovery codes can be
      refreshed at any time from your settings page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> For security reasons, Weasyl staff will be unable to assist you if
      you lose access to your recovery codes.
      <br />
      As a precaution against being locked out your account if all recovery codes are used, 2FA will
      automatically be disabled if--and only if--all recovery codes are consumed during the login process.
      Generating a new set of codes will prevent this from occurring. If this occurs, you will need
      to set-up 2FA again.

      These codes are one-time use, and upon successful use will not be able to be reused or retrieved.
