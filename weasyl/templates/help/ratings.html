    <h3>How Do I Rate Content I Submit?</h3>

    <div class="formatted-content">
      <section id="overview">
        <p>Content rating is determined on the existence and degree of six primary factors*: language, nudity, sexual situations, violence, drug use, and kinks/fetish content. The following outlines the acceptable criteria for each content rating:</p>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:8em;">General</th>
            <td>Appropriate for all audiences of all ages.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Mature</th>
            <td>Content that is not suitable for minors. May include non-sexual kink or fetish content, violence or profanity, as well as suggestive or implied sexuality, but excludes graphic depiction of sexual content or sexual acts, including depictions of sexual arousal.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Explicit</th>
            <td>Content that is graphic or sexual in nature. This may contain dramatized sex acts or overt sexual situations or sexual arousal. This rating also covers “harder” fetish material such as vore, blood, scat, watersports (urination), and overflowing/leaky diapers.</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

      <p>We ask that you use your best judgement when rating your content.
      Please consider the intended audience and context of the content you
      submit. When in doubt please use a higher rating. Below is a detailed
      guideline for content rating criteria:</p>

      <section id="general">
        <header>
          <h4>General</h4>
          <h5>All Audiences</h5>

          <p>Contains <strong>no</strong> mature or explicit content.  Content must be suitable for audiences under 18.</p>
        </header>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:10em;">Language</th>
            <td>May contain mild use of mild expletives or profanity.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Nudity</th>
            <td>May contain a compositional focus on sexualized anatomy (mammaries, buttocks, groin bulges, etc.) of clothed or partially clothed characters, or non-detailed nudity.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Sexual Situations</th>
            <td>May contain mild implications of sexual activity or themes. This includes implied sexual acts, references, behavior, or the presence of mild sexual situations or discussion. Sexualized or erotic fashion is permissible as long as it does not meet the criteria for Explicit.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Violence</th>
            <td>May contain mild violence or fantasy violence. May contain a small amount of imagery or situations that may be disturbing to sensitive viewers (e.g., depictions of disgusting or scary content in a horror or fantasy context). Violence depicted must not be gory or sexual in nature or heavily detailed/realistic.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Drug Use</th>
            <td>May contain mild drug use or implied use, including excessive consumption of alcohol or tobacco. May include incidental or comedic use of drugs such as marijuana, sativa, hallucinogens or prescription drugs.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Kinks/Fetishes</th>
            <td>Non-sexual kinks/fetishes such as babyfur/age regression, macro/micro, inflation, cartoon style transformations, and clean/dry diapers can be rated General. Content one might see on Cartoon Network is permitted in this rating.</td>

      <section id="mature">
        <header>
          <h4>Mature (Non-Sexual 18+ Content)</h4>
          <h5>Audiences Over the Age of Eighteen</h5>

          <p>Contains mature content of a non-sexual nature. Not suitable for minors. Restricted to viewers 18 and older.</p>

        <table class="help-ratings-table">
          <tr>
            <th style="width:10em;">Language</th>

            or vulgar language.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Nudity</th>
            <td>Full nudity where context is educational, artistic, or for the purpose of documenting anatomy is permissible. "Full nudity" includes exposed genitalia and/or nipples or areolae on developed and/or postpubescent mammaries. It also includes prominent definition of the aforementioned body parts through clothing.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Sexual Situations</th>
            <td>Equivalent to General. <strong>ANY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT
            CONTENT MUST BE CATEGORIZED IN THE EXPLICIT CATEGORY.</strong></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Violence</th>
            <td>May contain intense/realistic and graphic violence. May also include imagery or situations that may be considered highly disturbing or repulsive to the average viewer, such as serious injury, disembowelment, dismemberment, and excessive blood.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Drug Use</th>
            <td>May contain depictions of drug abuse and displays of drug
            paraphernalia.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>Kinks/Fetishes</th>
            <td>ost non-overtly-sexual kinks and fetishes are rated Mature, including wet/full diapers (not hyper or blowouts), vore, violent macro/crushing, light bondage, pregnancy, fat furs, breastfeeding, feral transformation, etc. A comprehensive list is impossible, but the rule of thumb is if there is no sexual stimulation directly depicted it is Mature.</td>

Furthermore, characters in provocative “pinup” poses who are presenting their genital or perianal regions in a provocative manner can be sexual content, even if those genital regions are concealed. Hyper-enlarged genitals or breasts in any context are sexual content. Certain fetishes and kinks such as BDSM can qualify as sexual content. <i>The final decision of what constitutes “sexual content” or what is merely suggestive is determined by Weasyl’s moderators.</i></td>

A comprehensive list is not possible, but the rule of thumb is if there is urination/defecation or explicit sexual activity involved, then it is rated Explicit.</td>
